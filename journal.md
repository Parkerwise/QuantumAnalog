Work today was focused on getting familiar with instruments and reading through the teachspin manual to get an idea of what data to collect for this experiment

Today we got our hands on the instruments. We were able to produce a waveform that corresponded to changing AC frequencies on the signal generator. We have been able to use the XY space to find the resonant frequencies, and more specifically we are able to find what frequencies coorespond to the peaks in our waveform. Once we have the resonant frequencies and their index, we should be able to interpret the speed of sound. Once we start collecting data it is important to record data regarding the temperature and such.
